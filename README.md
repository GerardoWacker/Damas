An online checkers game.

## Status
This is a one-time game. It's not intended to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, it'll be heavily updated in the months of March-June of '22.

## Running Damas
Releases should be flowing shortly.
However, if you have the required knowledge to set-up the project, you'll know what to do. 

## Developing for Damas
This is a personal project, so there's no need to commit into it. Nevertheless, if you want to help,  make sure you have the following before beginning:
- Java Runtime Environment version 17.
- Java Development Kit version 17.
- A compatible IDE. We recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

We also use the following dependencies:
- Socket.IO

To state changes in the codebase, you must follow certain steps:
- First, [create your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), based on the current codebase.
- Then, [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to notify us that your code is ready for review.

In this way, you may be able to turn into an active contributor of the Damas project.
